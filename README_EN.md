## 🌟 Overview

**7th-sense** is a demonstration repository created to learn **Git workflow**,  
while simultaneously serving as a **chaotic experimental field** where *anything may be committed* and *everything may be merged*.

This repository intentionally sustains duality:

### ✅ **ORDER — clean, structured, disciplined Git practice**  
### ✅ **CHAOS — unrestricted, unfiltered, anything-goes submission**

They coexist here.

## 🍊 About Kokan — The Project Mascot — The Project Mascot

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/kokan-avatar.png" width="240"/>
</div>


> Character created by **LoarenKonpeki**.

Kokan was originally a **public-service robot** living on **Konpeki Island**, assisting humans with:

- retrieving information  
- handling paperwork  
- managing daily tasks  
- communicating with residents  

During a devastating fire, she entered a low-power protection mode and hid within collapsed ruins.

Later, she was rebooted by **Loran** and **Queia**, but due to severe heat damage:

- major program modules were corrupted  
- memory was mostly erased  
- her speech became fragmented  
- behavior occasionally glitches  

Still, she remains gentle and devoted, often speaking with broken pauses:

> “Ko… Kokan w-w-will do her b-best to… to serve… y-you…”

She symbolizes:

- **Order** — her purpose  
- **Chaos** — her damaged state  

Just like this repository.

## 📚 Repository Purpose: *Order × Chaos*

### 🟦 **1. ORDER Mode — Proper Git Learning**

For structured practice:

- maintain a clean `main`  
- work on feature branches  
- write meaningful commit messages  
- follow PR → review → merge  
- sync upstream regularly  

---

### 🔶 **2. CHAOS Mode — Submit Anything**

In Chaos Mode:

- any file is allowed  
- any message is acceptable  
- any structure is valid  
- any format is welcome  
- nonsense is permitted  
- creativity is encouraged  

Your submission *is* the meaning.
